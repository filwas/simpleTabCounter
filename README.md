# simpleTabCounter

This is a simple Chrome Extension counter that displays how many tabs are open in the currently active Chrome window.

Additionally, it has an added functionality that allows it to click certain buttons at certain times in the webapp at my work.

To install: 
  1. download code and unpack somewhere safe
  2. in Chrome, go into options (three dots in top-right corner), then "More Tools" -> "Extensions"
  3. if it's not already turned on, click "developer mode" in top right corner
  4. click "load unpacked" and select the folder where you unpacked the code
  5. don't forget to pin the extension to your taskbar
